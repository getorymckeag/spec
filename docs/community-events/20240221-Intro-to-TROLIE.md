# Q & A

<section>

  <h3>Branches in our system model are nominated by a "From Bus" and a
  "To Bus"; they are not assigned a (synthetic) unique identifier. How will we
  be used the "resource-id" field to identify a branch when branches are not
  assigned a single identifier?</h3>

  <p>We created a new issue for this: <a href="https://github.com/trolie/spec/issues/54">#54</a>. Please join the discussion there.</p>
