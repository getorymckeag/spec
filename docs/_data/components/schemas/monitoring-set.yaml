  See https://trolie.energy/concepts.html#monitoring-sets for info on the 
  monitoring set concept in TROLIE.  

  This representation is intended to be enough for consumers to read it and tell where 
  the monitoring set came from, using metadata such as a source and an optional description.  
  It also includes the list of resources included in the monitoring set, as well as all
  their known aliases.
